this is an unsorted, unorganized(sorry 0_0) list of many of my projects ive worked on over the years.
this is not every project ive ever done, many have been lost to time :( (i didnt know what git was when i was in primary school)

this folder has been copied from PC to PC, compressed, decompressed, updated, and emaild to myself a substantial number times, so the creation date has
been updated and is currently set to 2019(i think), but some of these projects date back to 2012 (i was 9 years old) so dont judge my code too harshly lol
